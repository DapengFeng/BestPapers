##### Pose-NDF: Modelling Human Pose Manifolds with Neural Distance Fields

Garvita Tiwari, Dimitrije Antic, Jan E. Lenssen, Nikolaos Sarafianos, Tony Tung, Gerard Pons-Moll
```
For proposing a new approach to manifold learning using neural distance fields. The
paper offers applications to human body pose related tasks, showing the
expressiveness of the proposed learned prior in applications ranging from denoising
motion capture data, 3D pose estimation from images, and pose generation.

## Best Paper Honorable Mention

##### A Level Set Theory for Neural Implicit Evolution under Explicit Flows

Ishit Mehta, Manmohan Chandraker, Ravi Ramamoorthi

```
For providing an elegant and insightful theoretical background for unifying mesh
processing and efficient neural surface processing, pointing to exciting practical
applications in the future.
```

## Best Paper Award

##### On the Versatile Uses of Partial Distance Correlation in Deep Learning

Xingjian Zhen, Zihang Meng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Vikas Singh

```
Novel model correlation distance enabling a range of applications, including
conditioning deep models on other models, learning disentangled representations,
and optimizing diverse models, making them more robust to adversarial attacks.

## PAMI Mark Everingham Prize

Annual award given to a researcher, or a team of researchers, who
have made a selfless contribution of significant benefit to other
members of the computer vision community.

The Everingham Prize was created to commemorate Mark
Everingham who died in 2012, and to encourage others to follow in
his footsteps by acting to further progress in the computer vision
community as a whole.

Mark Everingham’s best known contribution is the organization of the
PASCAL VOC datasets and challenges.

The prize is awarded at ICCV and ECCV. The winners are selected by
the PAMI-TC awards committee.
