<p>The <a href="https://s2024.siggraph.org/program/technical-papers/">Technical Papers program</a> is a core element of the SIGGRAPH conference. It is the premier international venue for disseminating and discussing innovative scholarly work in animation, simulation, imaging, geometry, modeling, rendering, human-computer interaction, haptics, fabrication, robotics, visualization, audio, optics, programming languages, immersive experiences, and machine learning for visual computing to name a few. SIGGRAPH 2024 presents a special opportunity of the conference’s return to Colorado for the first time since its 1974 inception, where some of computer graphics’ most pivotal research was initially shared.</p>



<p>Following on the success of SIGGRAPH 2022 and SIGGRAPH 2023, SIGGRAPH 2024 accepted submissions to two integrated paper tracks: Journal (<em>ACM Transactions on Graphics</em>) and Conference. Additionally, SIGGRAPH 2024 continues the tradition of awards for Best Papers and Honorable Mentions. These papers were selected for their research prominence and new contributions to the future of research in computer graphics and interactive techniques.</p>



<p>SIGGRAPH 2024 Technical Papers Chair Denis Zorin is proud to highlight these award-winning papers and thanks the selection committee who chose the Best Papers and Honorable Mentions out of a pool of hundreds.</p>



<p>Learn more about the Best Papers, Honorable Mentions, and Test-of-Time awardees below, get ready to explore what’s next in research at SIGGRAPH 2024.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Best Papers</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From Microfacets to Participating Media: A Unified Theory of Light Transport With Stochastic Geometry</strong></h3>



<p>We derive a theory of light transport on stochastic implicit surfaces, a geometry model capable of expressing deterministic geometry, microfacet surfaces, participating media, and an exciting new continuum in between containing aggregate appearance, non-classical media, and more. Our model naturally supports spatial correlations, missing from most existing stochastic models.</p>



<p><em>Dario Seyb, Eugene d’Eon, Benedikt Bitterli, Wojciech Jarosz</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walkin’ Robin: Walk on Stars With Robin Boundary Conditions</strong></h3>



<p>We develop a grid-free Monte Carlo method for solving boundary value problems like the Poisson equation with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. Unlike conventional PDE solvers, our method does not require volumetric meshing or global solves. It is robust, embarrassingly parallel, scalable to complex geometry, and allows view-dependent evaluation.</p>



<p><em>Bailey Miller, Rohan Sawhney, Keenan Crane, Ioannis Gkioulekas</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Repulsive Shells</strong></h3>



<p>Shape spaces are a powerful tool for nonlinear interpolation, extrapolation, and averaging of geometric data, but previous shape spaces permit geometry to self-intersect in nonphysical ways. We introduce a shape space where geometry naturally avoids intersection, as well as an adaptive collision potential that prevents collision while converging under refinement.</p>



<p><em>Josua Sassen, Henrik Schumacher, Martin Rumpf, Keenan Crane</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lightning-Fast Method of Fundamental Solutions</strong></h3>



<p>This work introduces a variational preconditioner, based on the inverse Cholesky factorization, to improve the efficiency of solving dense systems discretized from boundary integral equations, effectively addressing the scalability issue commonly encountered in boundary-based approaches.</p>



<p><em>Jiong Chen, Florian Schäfer, Mathieu Desbrun</em></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robust Containment Queries Over Collections of Rational Parametric Curves via Generalized Winding Numbers</strong></h3>



<p>We extend the theory of generalized winding numbers to unstructured collections of rational parametric curves with a numerically stable algorithm, thereby allowing for robust and accurate containment classifications at arbitrary locations for non-watertight and self-intersecting shapes.</p>



<p><em>Jacob Spainhour, David Gunderman, Kenneth Weiss</em></p>
