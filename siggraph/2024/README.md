<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From Microfacets to Participating Media: A Unified Theory of Light Transport With Stochastic Geometry</strong></h3>



<p>We derive a theory of light transport on stochastic implicit surfaces, a geometry model capable of expressing deterministic geometry, microfacet surfaces, participating media, and an exciting new continuum in between containing aggregate appearance, non-classical media, and more. Our model naturally supports spatial correlations, missing from most existing stochastic models.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Walkin’ Robin: Walk on Stars With Robin Boundary Conditions</strong></h3>



<p>We develop a grid-free Monte Carlo method for solving boundary value problems like the Poisson equation with Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions. Unlike conventional PDE solvers, our method does not require volumetric meshing or global solves. It is robust, embarrassingly parallel, scalable to complex geometry, and allows view-dependent evaluation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Repulsive Shells</strong></h3>



<p>Shape spaces are a powerful tool for nonlinear interpolation, extrapolation, and averaging of geometric data, but previous shape spaces permit geometry to self-intersect in nonphysical ways. We introduce a shape space where geometry naturally avoids intersection, as well as an adaptive collision potential that prevents collision while converging under refinement.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lightning-Fast Method of Fundamental Solutions</strong></h3>



<p>This work introduces a variational preconditioner, based on the inverse Cholesky factorization, to improve the efficiency of solving dense systems discretized from boundary integral equations, effectively addressing the scalability issue commonly encountered in boundary-based approaches.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Robust Containment Queries Over Collections of Rational Parametric Curves via Generalized Winding Numbers</strong></h3>



<p>We extend the theory of generalized winding numbers to unstructured collections of rational parametric curves with a numerically stable algorithm, thereby allowing for robust and accurate containment classifications at arbitrary locations for non-watertight and self-intersecting shapes.</p>
